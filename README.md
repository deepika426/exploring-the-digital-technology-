# exploring-the-digital-technology- 
In the first class of this course, as a class activity, the whole class divided into small groups and asked us to observe the technology in our campus and make a list of them. After that, we talked about the instruments in class. 
In this course, we are studying computer software and how binary values are attached to our files, how execution and storage happen in our software devices, and how binary bits change from 8 to 64 bytes. 
We learn to convert binary to numbers and vice versa, both positive and negative numbers. 
We download the Linux in our systems and learn to code with the command prompt, in which we open the files without doing double click on our laptops.
After downloading the WSL, we learnt many codes like how to make a directory, file and how to play along with the directory and files. How to open our app using codes not with double clicking.
As part of the assignment, we did the presentations in small groups. In our group, we did a basic concept about computers in the book computer organization by Hamacher. In that we discussed abouut different computers and how the data instructions and memory work in different versions of computers, and we also talk about the number representation in computers and how the different algorithms work in  the computer. 
Other groups in the class talk about different topics and use different software for the presentations, One of the software is Miro, which is the digital collaborative  platform designed to facilitate remote and distributed team communication and project management. Another tool is Prezi AI, this platform is a visual storytelling  software alternative to traditional slide-based presentation formats. So from the different groups I learnT differnt tools and concepts more related to today's technology. 
As a class involvement, our instructor will provide many questions which are new to learn and exictes us to know more about that topic for example finding to do the email for thousands of members at a time with their respective names and i figure out how to do it using the excel sheet attch to the mail and send it. 
We are using the git hub account, but we don't know how to work in git, so we learnt about that only in this course. How to add to git and commit to it and using the gitk we can see when we use the git file did we make changes are not by that we can track when we did our file edited.
