In this course currently, we are studying computer software of computers and how binary values are attached to our files, how the execution and storage happen in our software devices, and how the binary bites change from 8 to 64 bytes. 
We learn to convert binary to numbers and vice versa, both positive and negative numbers. 
We download the Linux in our systems and learn to code with the command prompt, in which we open the files without doing double click on our laptops.
