As a part of this course we are suppose to do a small project in a group to explore more about technology and try to understand the concepts better which are thought in class by using the applications in our laptops. 
So as a group of three members : Me , sourav and sandeep deciced our topic as " Airlines reservation systems: How do flights get booked? "
In that topic we divide it into 3 subtopics as 1) History and structure of airlines , 2) Overbooking and passenger bumping and 3) dynamic pricing and fare algotithm 
I am mainly focusing on Overbooing and passenger bumping . The airlines do overbooikg to avoid flying empty seats and it's been a practice from decades. 
Airlines has many reasons to o overbooing that are passengers may cancel their tickets or last minute changes in travel plan these avoid the empty seats in flights. 
If there is no empty seat the airlines also get the maximimum revenue per flight and By reducing the number of empty seats in flight leads to lower the price for other passengers
If overbooking happens and all the people are present in flight in that situation they are two cases they will ask the passengers to voluntarily leave the flight
